# Dating App

## Project Description

This is a web application designed for dating, built using **Angular** for the frontend and **ASP.NET Core** for the backend. The application uses **SQLite** as a lightweight database to store user data, while **Bootstrap** ensures a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

### Technologies

- **Angular**: A framework for building dynamic, single-page applications (SPA) on the client side.
- **ASP.NET Core**: A backend framework for handling business logic and APIs.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database for storing user profiles and interactions within the app.
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework for creating a responsive and aesthetic user interface.

### Features

- User registration and login.
- User profile creation with options to edit personal information, upload photos, and set preferences.
- Browsing and searching other users' profiles based on specific criteria.
- Ability to like other users' profiles and send private messages.
- Matching system based on user preferences and location.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Backend (ASP.NET Core)**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```
   - The application will start on the default port (e.g., `https://localhost:5001`).

2. **Frontend (Angular)**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory.
   - Install dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Then start the frontend application:
     ```bash
     ng serve
     ```
   - The app will be available at `http://localhost:4200`.
